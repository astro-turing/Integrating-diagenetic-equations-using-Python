    It turns out the the Jacobian sparsity matrix, as provided by
    previous versions of this function was too strict. The diagonals
    had a width of 1, this implicitly assumes no dependencies of the
    Jacobian elements on fields at adjacent depths. A run with such
    a Jacobian sparsity matrix took a lot of compute power and time and
    ultimately halted without covering a single time step! A debugging 
    session with breakpoints inside solve_ivp showed that the Jacobian 
    matrix computed by `solve_ivp` (when neither the Jacobian nor the 
    Jacobian sparsity matrix was provided) has non-zero elements not 
    only on the diagonals but also on adjacent positions along the 
    diagonals. 
    See equation 2.58 from "Finite Difference Methods Finite for Differential
    Equations by Randall J. Leveque for an example of off-diagonal Jacobian
    matrix elements. This example is about the Jacobian for solving the pde 
    describing the motion of a pendulum with a certain mass at the end of a 
    rigid (but massless) bar.
